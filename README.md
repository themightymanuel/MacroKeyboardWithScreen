# MacroKeyboardWithScreen
 An ATMEGA32U4 powered macro keyboard.

This is still a work in progress. 

Parts List:

4	M5x8 Bolts<br/>
1	OLED 0.91" Screen with I2C<br/>
1	Rotary Encoder with Smooth Shaft<br/>
1	Arduino Pro Micro ATMEGA32U4 based board<br/>
1	Micro USB cable<br/>

I used crimp on dupont connections to make custom wires. However using dupont ribbons (just be careful there isn't a lot of extra room in the
case to fit a lot of wire) or even soldering the wires directly would work as well.
